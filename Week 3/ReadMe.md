# Linear Programming

## Introduction
Linear Programming is defined as a linear function of a number of variables to be optimized (maximized or minimized), when such variables are subject to a number of constraints in the mathematical linear equalities ot inequalities. 

In short, it is a mathematical optimization technique used to maximize or minimize a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. It is commonly used in resource allocation, production planning, transportation problems, and portfolio optimization.

## General Formulation
The goal of LP is to optimize (maximize or minimize) an objective function of the form:

$$Z= c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \dots + c_nx_n$$

where $z$ is the objective function, $c_i$ are the coefficients and $x_i$ are the decision variables.

The above objective function is subject to constraints which are linear equations or inequalities that limit the feasible region (the set of all possible solutions that satisfy the constraints of the problem). 

$$A_x \leq b \text(  Inequality Constraint)$$
$$A_x = b \text(  Equality Constraint)$$
