# Linear Programming
Linear Programming is defined as a linear function of a number of variables to be optimized (maximized or minimized), when such variables are subject to a number of constraints in the mathematical linear equalities ot inequalities. 

In short, it is a mathematical optimization technique used to maximize or minimize a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. It is commonly used in resource allocation, production planning, transportation problems, and portfolio optimization.


\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize } & Z = c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \dots + c_nx_n \\
\text{Subject to } & a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \dots + a_{1n}x_n \leq b_1 \quad \text{(Time Constraint)} \\
                   & a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \dots + a_{2n}x_n \leq b_2 \quad \text{(Labour Constraint)} \\
                   & \vdots \\
                   & a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \dots + a_{mn}x_n \leq b_m \quad \text{(Other Constraints)} \\
\text{and } & x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \geq 0 \quad \text{(Non-Negativity Constraint)}
\end{align*}
