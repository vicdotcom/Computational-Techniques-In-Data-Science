# Week 1: Introduction to Stochastic Programming

## Introduction
Stochastic Programming is a mathematical framework for modelling optimization problems that involve uncertainity. Unlike deterministic programming which assumes perfect information, in stochatsic progamming, some or all of its problem parameters are uncertain, but follow known probability distributions as is common in real-world models and systems.
