# Deterministic Programming
A deterministic process is where all variables, objectives and constraints are known with certainity. It therefore involves no randomness and its values can be determined solely by past and present conditions. 

Examples of optimization models/problems include linear and non-linear programming models which are considered deterministic because:
  - Their objective function, constraints and coefficients are known with certainity.
  - They are predictable: Their optimal solution is fixed
  - They do not model uncertainities or random variables. They assume all values are known and fixed.

Python tools such as SciPy and CVXPY are used to optimize deterministic optimization problems.
