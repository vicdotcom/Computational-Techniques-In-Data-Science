# Week 3: Random Walk
A random walk is a type of stochastic process where a variable takes steps randomly in some space (i.e.- time, position, value). It decsribes the current observation as equal to the previous observation plus a random change (i.e.- a random step up, down, left or right).

$$X_t= X_(t-1) + w_t$$ or $$X_(t+1)= x_t + w_t$$
