# Introduction
A graph $(G)$ is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relationships between objects. It consists of a pair of points $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of objects called vertices (representing entities such as locations, cities) and $E$ is a set of two elements called edges (representing reltionships such as roads, pipes). Consider the simple graph $G$ below:

It consists of vertices $V(G)= \{a,b,c,d,e\}$ and edges $E(G)= {ab, bc, cd, de, ae}$
